Thank you for checking out my SnipPi for your Raspberry Pi.

SnipPi is a snipping tool to capture images of an actual window, fullscreen or user defined areas.
When you use SnipPi you will notice it will automatically minimize itself so be out of the way. The cursor will not be in the 
capture you take.

How to unzip SnipPi.zip via File Manager:
-----------------------------------------
Go to the directory to where you downloaded SnipPi.zip is located on your Raspberry Pi and right click on your mouse 
and select Extract Here or Extract To... so you can select where you want it installing.

then you can simply double click on the SnipPi icon and selecting Execute box to start using SnipPi.

How to unzip SnipPi.zip via terminal window:
--------------------------------------------
On the command line using (example: cd Downloads) to the directory SnipPi.zip is located, you can check if it is in the 
current directory by entering: ls
This would give a list of files in your current directory.
Once located on the command line enter: sudo unzip SnipPi.zip
You will see output to the screen that the appropiate files are unzipping.

then you can enter on the command line enter: ./SnipPi to start using SnipPi.



I hope you find SnipPi very useful.
Martin Parker.
